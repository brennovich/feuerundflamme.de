Spring Festival aka 💫🐉🥠***CHINESE NEW YEAR***🐲🥟✨ is coming up next **SATURDAY 10. FEB 2024** - a perfect excuse to **fire up the oven** and welcome the Year of the Dragon! Starting the oven at 11 am & starting to bake at around 2 - 3 pm.

**Spring Festival aka Chinese New Year** is coming up next Saturday, 10. February - a perfect excuse to **fire up the oven** and welcome in the Year of the Dragon! Starting the oven at 11 am & starting to bake at around 2 - 3 pm.
<br>
For this occasion, we will prepare **some Teigtaschen**, which are still in the form of this festival food, but probably not the most Chinese traditional one.  <br>
**Everyone is of course very welcome to bring their own dough, their own version of dumplings, or their own favourite type of festival food.** <br>
Just keep in mind that the the oven will be set to low-medium heat, which is perfect for bread, pie, cakes, etc, but not really for pizza. 
<br>
We plan to start setting up around 11am, so hopefully the oven will be ready around 13-14pm.
<br>
The oven is currently located at the **Sommerquartier**. Your can find a map here: https://feuerundflamme.xyz/kontakt/

A small donation for wood and space is always appreciated.
<br>
Hope to see you there!
